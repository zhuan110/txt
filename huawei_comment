In a photo comparison of croissants, Huawei was very close to Google, but the Pixel was the one that really conveyed the flaky texture of the pastry, while Huawei presented a less grainy but also less realistic image.
No pics :disappointed:

I find the Google Pixel camera still retains the most fine-grained detail out of any phone camera.
I was looking for this. Every time I look at a picture taken by the Pixel, I find myself marvelling at it. The Huawei camera may win on some fronts, but imo the Pixel is still the cameraphone king.

What about the S10’s video capabilities? In the reviews by The Tech Chap, Mr Whoseboss and Everything Apple Pro, the videos of the S10 looked superior to the iPhone XS.

Well that’s a stretch. The P30Pro wins with lowlight and zoom by a leap, the difference by daylight are a lot smaller between the different brands.
Both the Pixel and the P30 are devices you mainly choose because of the camera, because on the hardware end both are not the best on the market for the price asked (Pixel is far from it).
So when comparing both for the cameras, I don’t see why I’d pick the Pixel over the P30Pro. The zoom, the lowlight performance are vastly better on the P30Pro, I’d go with the latter.

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 9:03 AM

The pixel’s detail allows some of its images to pass for DSLR shots at small size, whereas I can tell the P30 shots have that mobile smudgy and oversharpened look from a mile away. If I really like the Pixel’s daytime shot but don’t really like any of the Huawei’s shots, I might choose the Pixel. And the Pixel’s Night Mode is still great. But yes, that 5x lens is wild and the TOF does wonders.

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 9:39 AM
EveryDayIs
I get your point. The Pixel’s detail is great, by good light in comparison to the P30 Pro. When looking all-round, I think the P30 Pro is a more obvious choice. The detail the Pixel offers by good light goes the moment it gets darker (again, in comparison to the P30 Pro, the Pixel’s camera(software) is still better than other’s on the market).

For me personally neither of these phones cuts it in the general hardware/software department outside of the camera, but the P30 Pro’s is more of an all-round winner in the camera department to me.

Galaxy S10 and iPhone X (latter is a workphone). Both phones offer better hardware/software in general to me (I’m so bored of stock Android), but in the camera department it’s annoying not to have capabilities like the P30Pro. Love what Samsung did with the wideangle, but damn I scratched the back of my head when I saw the P30Pro release.

There’s actually a big difference, but first off, you missed his "/s."

The difference is two-fold: 1) we’re willingly giving our data to Google/Facebook/Apple in return for something, and 2) Google/Facebook/Apple aren’t collecting it to blackmail us, which is the biggest concern with China, and why a Chinese company buying Grindr is so concerning.

Google/Facebook/Apple aggregate your data into an anonymized profile to serve you ads that better fit your interests. China is looking for either industry secrets from your employer to steal, or highly confidential information about someone who can give them access to such secrets in order to keep that information confidential. I’d call it an enormous, enormous difference.

I still want a Huawei phone.

About me? I do have access to industry information I’m sure they’d love, but nothing they’d care about too much. But if you’re a CEO, or an engineer, you likely have access to much more. Things that may move through your phone.

Or, why the Grindr thing is a big deal – since plenty of government employees still closeted are on it.

Listen, I’m not saying Huawei is doing this, but he said if they are, so what, since Facebook does. China would do it for very different reasons. Keep in mind, Alibaba hasn’t launched in the us and has no plans to just yet.

While I wouldn’t say it’s a joke, it does seem like a proof of concept, and I agree that smartphone cameras are in a weird sort of uncanny valley where companies are focusing so much on them — often at the expense of most other aspects of the device — that I’m not sure why someone wouldn’t just get any number of superior actual cameras if they prioritize picture quality.

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 8:45 AM
vladsavov  Senior Vlad
This is an interesting point of discussion.

Majority of my colleagues are in the same camp as you. I’m of a different mind, and here’s why. The phone part of a phone is really hard to differentiate on: sizes are almost identical, displays are all good to great, wireless performance differences are minor. But the camera, that’s where the Pixel enjoy(ed, before this phone) a humongous lead, the iPhone is good, and the P30 Pro is exceptional. Most people undervalue just how important a good-to-great camera is to their lives until they actually need one.

All of the above being said, Huawei definitely managed to screw up solved problems: the display, the UX. It also manages to get unusually awesome wireless performance and marathon battery life into this phone, so it’s a complicated matter. More complicated than just declaring the phone a joke, I would say.

For what it’s worth, I’m inclined to agree. I’m an iPhone user, and I bought into that ecosystem back with the 3G specifically because Apple was the sole mobile company at the time that recognized how important mobile photography was to the overall device experience. While I still (mostly) love iOS and there are a lot of ancillary reasons I’m unwilling to switch now, I have to admit that whenever I see P30 Pro and Pixel photo comparisons, I find myself insanely jealous and my mind runs immediately to wondering how dominant Apple would be if it had that kind of performance in its devices.

Ah well, maybe in 2021.

That’s the thing Vlad doesn’t detail what the Nova launcher actually solves. Was it that the UI was too much of a hybrid between iOS and Android? I bought a used P30 Pro after the Trump administration blacklisted the company and people were afraid they’d get no software updates (some still are on that) and prices on eBay jumped down.
I find the default UI just fine – I’ve only known the latest software release, but I really wonder what he was trying to solve with the 3rd party updates he installed – cause I’m not running into problems.
The camera performance is really just as mind blowing as Vlad talks about…its amazing.

Most shortsighted post I’ve seen in a while. Using a different launcher already solves this for the majority of users that are not the small minority niche that buy a pixel because of the software.

Huawei is number two in smartphone market share, calling this a joke simply makes you the joke. You have to get real here, and realize a lot of people buy smartphones because of the camera, and it’s king in that aspect.

"It’s small things like not letting me pull down the quick settings shade on the lock screen to turn on the flashlight. "

You need to pull up from the bottom. It’s silly, I know, but it’s there.

Having owned the phone for a week now, I concur with this review. The fingerprint sensor is a bit meh, and will probably need to try to store my fingerprints again. It does require you to push hard for the fingerprint to be detected. And the curved display is a bit of a gimmick and annoyance – perhaps I should have gone for the non-pro version which has a normal 2D screen. But the colours are nice and it is sufficiently bright for an OLED.

The camera is good, but perhaps a bit over-hyped. I don’t think it’s as great as the journalists are portraying it. But I am more than happy with the phone overall.

How well is the color green captured by the camera since it is using the unique RYYB. or really can’t spot the diff at all?

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 8:50 AM

Greens are still green. But, as I say in the review, there’s a general bias toward a red tint in outdoor shots.

All the photos in that comparison were taken in the same lighting conditions, which look as the left-most image suggests. So yes, very low light.

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 9:17 AM

Do you see yourself posting the right photo on instagram? without context that it is a low light photography, people’s going to think that the photo is washed out or overexposed.

Not to mention Americans don’t know much of anything about Huawei anyway. If they released it here, it would flop instantly since the U.S. has so much Apple/Samsung brand loyalty compared to pretty much any other country. They’d have to get carrier branding deals from all 4 nationwide carriers and we already know that the two largest carriers won’t do it.

I have just bought a P30 Pro to replace a Pixel 2XL whose battery has virtually died after 3 months! It is a big adjustment after have had a pure Android experience and it is definitely not as smooth as a pixel 2 despite having a faster processor. But the fingerprint sensor works way better than my pixel 2 which just used to decide to take days off at a time and which I reloaded my fingerprints into on countless occasions. And the Wifi performance is much better than my iPhone and Pixel 2. The NFC when tapping into the tube is also much faster.

As for the camera experience, that is mixed, camera launch is faster and the zoom is better, but the quality of photos versus the Pixel 2 is not clear cut. I feel that the pixel 2 would focus faster and was better for quick shots, but it is early days still.

But coming to the real reason that I didn’t go for the Pixel 3, which was about battery life. How Google could have the Pixel 3 regressing in battery life? But as Vlad says, the battery life on the P30 Pro is just unbelievable. Moving from the Pixel 2 XL where I had to charge it at work, I am now going home with over 60% battery life

>> How Google could have the Pixel 3 regressing in battery life? <<

Well, I guess that’s the point of your article :blush: I was just responding to ACW90’s baseless claims.

Speaking to your point Vlad…

The battery life argument is sort of like the RAM argument for me. Meaning, it’s easy to just load in more RAM or battery, but what’s the point? Other than to pump up specs?

In my family we have two Xs Max 256 and two Xr 128. All heavy users, none of us ever run out of battery. So what’s the point in having more?

Occasionally I spend a lot of time on the road using Maps and that’s the only time I’ll plug in midday, because mapping programs are battery hogs, and I don’t know that any phone battery will stretch to accommodate 6 hours of map use.

Regarding still pics. When the articles comparing the iPhone to the last Huawei (the 20, I guess) and Pixel came out I genuinely thought the iPhone pics looked better. Both of the others looked horribly over-processed to me. I’ll give up the detail in that trade, and I can always post-process for the occasional low-light shit. (Or my wife can, she has the talents there.)

I haven’t seen any direct comparisons of the P30 to the iPhone, but the "fair" comparisons will be to the 2019 iPhone, which obviously isn’t out yet.

Thank you for reviewing this camera even though it’s not available in the US. I’d assumed that the light having to travel the additional distance via the periscope would result in darker images, but this is impressive. The west has viewed China as merely a production hub for too long so it’s good to see them taking the spotlight with innovation like this. Had Apple created this, they’d be shouting it from the rooftops, so I’m guessing they’ll wait a few years before quietly copying this.

I finally handled one today, it felt smaller than the specs suggest; Vlad mentioning how the curve cuts into usable screen really struck a chord with me. My Mi 5 with its 16:9 screen at 5.15" was only barely narrower than the P30 Pro. Most of the P30 Pro’s screen’s real estate went to height, but it just feels like the screen is taller, and doesn’t give the sense of roominess that a proper big screen does.

Some of your issues with the software seem like they may be premature in some cases. Is there not a swipe up on the lock screen to use the flashlight? And is there not a setting in the camera app itself to turn on double tap down volume to open the camera/take photo from lock?

Posted  on Apr 10, 2019 | 1:19 PM
vladsavov  Senior Vlad
The quick settings from the bottom of the lock screen are something I’d forgotten about. But good luck finding them as a newcomer, since they’re unlabelled and the typical swipe-up gesture on lock screen is already occupied with launching the camera. It’s a change from the basic Android operation purely for the sake of copying iOS.

As to using the volume button to trigger the camera: what do you think happens to that shortcut when you’re listening to music?

The oil painting look, which iPhones and Galaxy devices are just as guilty of, can sneak in on P30 Pro shots: when photographing crowds, I often end up with people’s faces looking like they were deliberately smudged to protect their identities.

One of the main reasons I switched to the original Pixel from an iPhone (6s & 7 Plus at the time). There are tons of posts on Apple’s help forums about this issue and my guess is Apple thinks its fine.

Strange review from Vlad.

You mention changing the launcher but why? Because you don’t like the icons?

I struggle to see any noteworthy difference between the stock android launcher and the Huawei one?

You mention performance is fast and smooth yet cite "buggy" software, for Twitter crashes?

HiView hasn’t nagged me at all

What overbearing permissions does it ask for? The only requests I got from Huawei came when I opted to turn on HiVoice, which require microphone etc.

I’ve had no crashes at all.

My screen doesn’t exhibit the issues you mention at edges.

You praise battery life yet lament lack of superfluous QHD. That’s your answer! I’d expect an educated reviewer to praise a company making sensible decisions. (Binning QHD for better battery life)

Why is your subheading bringing nationality into discussion? You do realise basically all electronics are made in China? Shall we headline your articles with "Bulgaria’s take on mobiles" or just look at your end product?

The biggest piece of garbage phone I bought in the last 12 years was a Huawei. After six months it started turning to junk.

The best construction? Nokia. Phone looked new after two years with no protector.

Huawei not being junk would be a big surprise. Wait six months and review it again.

DP Review did a review of the P30 Pro, they thought it was a "good camera for a phone". LOL…….call me when a smartphone camera outperforms a Nikon D850 or any medium format.




Remember when Sony was being shot down for announcing a new flagship every 6 months...   yet no complaints the Chinese brands seem to announce a new flagship to their range every month!

Huawei P30 is a good phone. If you are going to switch from old phone to this one, you can use ApowerManager to transfer your data.

Samsung where ya at?  My Pixel 3 XL took great night photos (that's the only thing good it did, P.O.S).  Samsung S10+ can't hold a candle to the low light/night sight in Pixel 3.  

Remember when we used to say Samsung steals everything from Apple.  Well Samsung go steal the night sight thing from Google's Pixel.

I have too many reservations about ever supporting this brand. First of all they have no respect for patents. Second of all, their country of origin is currently trying to screw my country simply for respecting our own rule of law. Their CFO Meng Wanzhou is currently being extradited by Canada at the request of the US. The Chinese government is trying to put pressure on us (to violate our own laws and piss off the USA) by arresting our citizens in China and implementing trade blocks that will damage our economy. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-hearing-canada-1.5039293

I just love to read the comedies in Engadget's comment section. The U.S. is the only reason why Huawei is a household name around the world now.

 Sad people are so thirsty to prove that Huawei has great innovative / competitive devices, BUT when Huawei's CFO Meng was arrested, they found her with Apple devices. Even Meng knows which devices are more superior.

How embarrassing for Huawei!

hehehehe

Huawei, does a nice job of marrying the Samsung Galaxy and OnePlus 6T.  Design truly is commoditized.  Regardless it being a Chinese company, should always pause any user in purchase. 

I know they are independent , but when you are talking about a country that made their leader's position a lifetime appointment, they have direct access to virtually all messaging and put hard restrictions on what can be posted on social media, you would have to be really myopic to not see how easy it would be to integrate into any cell phone regardless of location on the globe.

Though, considering what the EU and Russia have been doing and even the US it does seem privacy from gov't is becoming harder and freedom in media is too.

I like how you say "even the US" - the US has 16 intelligence agencies within its various Government departments.  They are just as prone to state monitoring as anyone, probably more so (edit; more so compared to your EU example etc).

Yeah the addition was more directed at the "we are 'merica" crowd :), Though historically the U.S. was very different than other places. I would not say EU surveals less than the U.S. There is nothing really that supports that. Especially when you consider the history of internal threats such as  IRA, Black September, ETA, Mafia,Cold War.

Yes, I know the lesser of two evils context.  At least Samsung and Apple actually have R & D departments.
Too me, the most disrespectful business act one can do is steal other companies IP, then undersell said company.  
To that end, I want to foster innovation forward, not drag it down to stagnation.  Those who by Hung-crap, are simply fostering stagnation.

You do realize Huawei had the 5th highest R&D spending in the world at $13 billion, behind #1 Samsung ($15 billion) and ahead of #7 Apple ($11 billion), right? You also realize that all companies, including Samsung and Apple, have committed IP violations, right?

Name one thing the $13 billion in supposed R & D has produced regarding IP that stands firmly from the R & D  of Huawei?  Having an R & D budget and actually using said budget for R & D are two very different perspectives.  And, yes, it still does cost a lot of money to copy others.

Nice bullshit there Mark. How about you lookup the facts and then write something.

High-end Huawei phones are more durable than any iPhone I have ever had. 2 of my iphones bent from normal day use, speakers stop working etc. Then I got Huawei P20 Pro, and say what you want, it's better phone than anything Apple has ever produced, from build quality to photos. I can only imagine that P30 Pro is even better in every aspect.

Except in this story, knockoff Prosche is any Apple product. They wear down more quicker than anything else. Iphone speakers fail, some internal cables unplug if you drop it, batteries expand, body bends, phone gets slower over time, etc. While Huawei has zero issues like that. My P20 Pro is hands down the best phone I have ever seen. P30 can only be better. And I did use iPhones from version 1 to 7. 

So please, continue living in your glass house, but at least don't spread your ignorant, biased opinion onto us. You don't know sh!t. So... wake up Mark.

Well, I simply disagree with your assessment.  Over ripe pictures, with poor foreground detail, a number of stupid settings which have no common sense, face unlock is garbage, no wireless charging, to name a few.  
And a whole review that tends to be in agreement: https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/954161/Huawei-P20-Pro-test-tough-break-screen

They don't do knock off well.  So wake up kamil85 to my opinion, backed by many objective review sites.  Again, if you like it; great.  And if you would care to look under the hood and debate the circuit board, and how it was knocked off down to the test points. . . 
But, that would mean you would have to know your shit.  Wanna go there?

Engadget has international readership. 

If you really want to be annoyed, consider the conflicting ethics that would lead a site to publish the above after right after putting out the below: 

https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/20/we-need-to-talk-about-huawei/

Even worse, in the latter article, “(alleged)” was added to the headline after publication and not disclosed in any public change-log or article note.

At what point do we say that stealing is bad? And when is it bad enough to make you rethink your buying...

I absolutely hate when I see people taking selfies, pictures of their food or in front of things they don't own to front like they own it.  

Of course I've taken selfies, of course I've taken photos of food but I do it in privacy.  And I never take photos of shit I don't own.  It would be pointless since I don't do social media.

To me it just looks pathetic and self-absorbed.  Social media is nothing but people crying for attention.  Look at what I bought, ate, drove, visited, etc.  Half the time it's as BS anyway.  

In fact we need to just put the phones down period.  I literally was driving through a shopping center parking lot.  This individual was staring down at his phone walking directly in front of and towards my car.  I stopped to see how far he would go before he realized he was about to walk into my car.  2 ft!  I know I sound like my grand parents.

So? The tech some people are worrying about is the professional networking tech, not the consumer stuff. Imagine, why bother with installing spyware in 10k devices, when you could just snoop on everyone through the 1 LTE cell tower those 10k devices link up to?
