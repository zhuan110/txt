I still wonder why the pixel can get ahead of an IMX586 with merely a IMX363. If it’s google’s software, why can’t we just install google camera on OP7? Or is it still different?

Gcam on other devices as the Google Pixel is a myth to me. Since the OP3 and now the OP6 I constantly give Gcam a try but I always head back to the stock cam. Gcam still crashs from time to time, it’s not as stable and fast to open as the stock cam. It doesn’t even produce the better image in every scenario. Night mode, of course, easy win for Gcam, but in a lot of other – more common – scenarios, the stock cam takes the better pictures for me. I won’t say don’t use Gcam, but if you want the Pixel experience then… get a Pixel. Don’t get a Oneplus and think you can add Gcam to get the same experience as on the Pixel. Saying that, I’m very happy with the image quality of pictures taken with my Oneplus 6. Smartphone cameras have come a long way and we have to take pictures in nearly pitch black environments to see any differences without holding each picture side by side in full resolution. I don’t think the everyday buyer will every be dissatisfied with the camera of the Oneplus 7 nor the Oneplus 7 Pro. It’s just the fact for us techies, that the Pixel cam is unmatched in reliability and quality, but on a very high level.

I have the OP3 and the OP6 as well, and I can see that gcam is not optimized well, but there are phones with the same sensor, sometimes even the same aperture, so did google intentionally make the generic gcam bad on purpose?

Gcam is simply optimized for the Pixel line’s camera. There are more to a camera than just a sensors; the lens components matter too.

Because a great camera (just like a great phone) is always the result of combination of software + hardware, not just hardware.

If it’s google’s software, why can’t we just install google camera on OP7? Or is it still different?
Because Google Camera is optimized for Pixel hardware, simple as that. And a developer from XDA porting the app can’t achieve the same level of software + hardware integration Google Engineers did.

I’ve tested the Google Camera port on over a dozen phones, and 90%+ of the time it’s either: lagged, crashed, froze, took forever to process pictures, or night shots came out with a blue/reddish tint or blurry that took XDA devs months to try to fix but still not perfectly.

I installed the one of the gcam versions for my fathers Moto X4 and it isn’t that much slower than the regular moto camera app and the quality is a little better than stock app and night sight works decently too.

No, friends, it’s almost entirely about that unparalleled Pixel camera.
Sure, if all you do with your phone is take photos; and having followed you on Twitter, I think that is your primary use for a phone. But for anything else, you have to be out of your mind to prefer the Pixel over this phone. Pixel offers nothing over this phone other than the camera.

And I’m starting to buy less and less into the Pixel camera hype. It’s king in low light. But anything else, it’s just a contrast-crazy camera.

I don’t know Vlad, I mean in your review you’re saying you’d pick the Pixel 3a for its camera alone, even though it’s objectively (not subjectively, objectively) the lesser phone. I mean if you’re willing to let go of so much for gains in the camera department, then camera must be the absolute number 1 priority for you. It also explains why you’ve stuck with the Pixel 3 despite its myriad of issues.

Considering the average consumer takes lots of pictures, how does your point make his judgement any less valid? Your typical Karen isn’t spec-obsessed like you, she just cares the phone isn’t slow, that battery life is great, and that she can take great pictures of her food and kids during any light conditions to post on Instagram. For people like Karen, the Pixel is a far better phone than the OnePlus 7. You forget Android Enthusiasts are a minority.

I disagree completely, and you kinda sorta contradict yourself too.

Your typical Karen isn’t spec-obsessed like you, she just cares the phone isn’t slow, that battery life is great, and that she can take great pictures of her food and kids

If your typical karen cares that the phone isn’t slow, she’d likely go with a phone that’s likely to remain not slow for a longer time i.e.one with higher specs. Also, the general consensus everywhere is that the pixel isn’t fast or slow, it’s okay, while the oneplus is plenty quick for its class.

And the point about taking good pictures – its not as if the oneplus takes shitty pictures. You’ll have to dig really deep to find a phone from top manufacturers in 2019 that takes bad pictures. Nearly all cameras are acceptably good, its just that some are much better. The obsession with professional grade smartphone photographs is largely restricted to tech commentators, bloggers and enthusiasts mostly. How many average people even download their pictures on a pc? Heck, how many users in emerging markets even have a pc? (places like india have plenty of users who only own a smartphone as a computing device)
If the majority of camera usage is for sharing on whatsapp (emerging markets particularly) or social media, an average phone by xiaomi, oneplus, samsung etc. is plenty good.

If "Karen" doesn’t upgrade her phone every year I think the performance difference between the two is enough to make the difference.

The 3a (and even standard flagship Pixel 3) already feels "meh" as far as performance goes if we’re being generous, and maybe that’s fine if it maintains at meh, but in all likelihood it will do what all tech does and slouch in performance over the years with updates, developers raising the floor on their apps each year, and just general cruft from long usage that most people won’t know how to fix (try telling Karen to factory rest her phone every six months and see how well that goes over.)

If I were getting a family member one of the two I’d easily go for the OP7 as I don’t really question the longevity of it the same way I do the 3a.

And while yes most people take lots and lots of pictures (and video, which is something Pixels aren’t necessarily great at, but that’s a whole other can of worms) most pictures for most people seem to live and die on Facebook, Insta, and Snap. So long as the OP7 camera is competent (and by all accounts it seems to be) it should be more than fine for most people.

Let’s be honest… 
"Karen" wouldn’t have noticed a difference in camera quality for most of her day-day pics. "Karen" also won’t be able to tell the difference in day-day performance between a Snapdragon 670 and 855. But I bet you money Karen will think both phones are inferior because they’re not an iPhone. Most of the "Karens" I know are more concerned whether their texts are blue or green, than they are with frivolous nerd stuff like spec comparisons.

My wife has the pixel3, and I can tell you from first hand experience that the pixel camera hype is real. Even compared to the Galaxy S10 and iPhone XR camera, the pixel will stand out in almost every lighting condition. We shot beach pictures with sun setting in the background, and somehow the pixel managed better HDR exposure on people in the foreground than my Sony RX100m2. 
If camera is a priority, pixel is the phone even with any other compromises. Pixel 3a also has a headphone jack for folks who prefer those.

I completely agree with Pixelated. I don’t understand why you’d choose an inferior phone just for a camera. A cam with pics that most people wouldn’t even choose in a blind test anyway. And if you’re gonna go that route go use a huawei phone, you’re just in it for the camera right, all those other problems shouldn’t matter then.

One of the things about the 3a that gets me is the amount of no name parts they used on the mobo. Plus they used some sort of ram/memory combo that I haven’t seen used before (not saying it hasn’t, but it ain’t in the Pixel 3). I also worry that they pulled a Xiaomi and used B grade internals in order to hit a price point. This was the norm for Nexus phones. 
With all the hype, I have to assume that it’s a great phone, but I have been burned a couple of times by buying cheap Google/Nexus products. Camera or not, I don’t think I can be talked into doing it again.

It’s like we’ve all developed collective amnesia about the glorious, polycarbonate-clad Nokia N9.
I still take it out of the drawer and hold it sometimes. And it wasn’t just the hardware that was stupendous. Side note – the only other phone that has ever fascinated me as much as the N9, at least to hold and handle, is the Nokia Lumia 735, which wasn’t even a unibody. Wanted it as a second phone. Ordered one from Amazon, turned out to be fake. Ordered another from Ebay China – also fake. Alas.

If you ever find a Lumia 735 on the cheap, even used (I think plenty are available on e-bay in the US and Europe), I strongly recommend that you buy it, if only to reinforce the memory of what we have collectively lost.

The main underlying problem is that OnePlus stopped being a "great value for money" brand.
And they’re not good enough to be a good premium brand either.

People buy either the premium or the good value for money phones, and OnePlus now isn’t either of those.

They are now at the LG/Motorola flagship price point. Almost as good as a real flagship, almost as expensive, but the people with that kind of money are also buying into a status or a statement.

LG and Moto had the advantage of being peddled by carriers and even then they barely sell their "premium" flagships.

One thing you might want to correct, Vlad, Xiaomi uses MIUI, not EMUI. One of both is an aberrant mix of iOS and Android and actually appeals to a ton of people (although I personally loathe it), the other is a skin of Android which I also despise, but it is way different.

I cross my fingers for an Android One version of the Mi 9 which is not likely to happen, but would be awesome to get.

OnePlus should splurge on the marketing dollars in the US to get this phone out there more. This is a great time in TV, for example, with lots of eyes on NBA playoffs and the heart of the baseball season upon us.

This is a situation where I have to believe unit profit margins are lower than past few iterations, but easily offset that in a large volume of sales.

I should have specified, I switched to glass protectors a couple years ago and can't see myself going back to plastic ("film") again.  The feel is *so* much better, and I basically never have to replace the protector unless the phone drops and it gets cracked.  I think I've seen a few companies talk about making more durable plastic protectors, or even "curved glass" sheets, but I've heard bad things about both.  I just want a phone where the front glass is flat -- I know it's not the design trend we're seeing now, but to me it's important.

I used to think like you but s8 screen has been pretty durable. It even survived a drop! but it was a in a very thin case. curved glass screen protectors don't work with s8 AFAIK but plastic ones do and I've no problem.

If you are concern about not able to protect curved screen, curved tampered glass screen protector have been available since Samsung introduced the Edge screen. Of course, There are some crappy tampered glass supplier, and some good ones. I would recommend going to the smartphone manufacturer's forum to see which tamper glass supplier, users find best fit for the device, and avoid judging a product base on random reviews from random forums and tamper glass supplier.

It's hard to tell but I believe it's plastic but it's SUPER smooth. It's REALLY close to the edges, you can't even tell it's there unless you really look. I've had it for 2 weeks now and no scratch issues. I try to be pretty careful but I also don't baby it. 
Overall though I'm VERY happy with the phone. I'm tired of hearing comparisons on size and weight that it's so massive of a phone and blah blah blah, but it's right on par with the Note and they never have that in the comparison. I have no issues with it. Great phone.

I hear you. As our unit was handled by OnePlus' US team, we only got the 7 Pro which is the only model available in the US.

But what I can say is that the 7 is very much just a 6T upgraded with a new CPU, new cameras, stereo speakers and better in-display fingerprint reader. It's mainly just missing out on the 90Hz screen refresh rate and QHD+ resolution. You may refer to our 6T review for our thoughts on the form factor and the dewdrop notch, and then refer to our 7 Pro review for the performance of the in-display fingerprint reader, main camera plus front camera.

That is to say, the 7 is what the 6T should have been. Then it just boils down to the pricing.

Huh?  It has higher resolution sensor than you would have if you had it on the front and it only presents itself when you are doing selfies.  So for 100% of your use time you get a full, notchless screen and the <.1% of the use time you are doing selfies you have a high resolution camera that pops up.   Seems like a amazingly great solution to me.

7 Pro also doesn't support ext memory, usb c (slower transfer speeds) and the Samsung will also have 10x more accessories. For those that dont like bloated OS's, you can always find a ROM for a Sammy that gives you a clean OS. The 7 Pro is a great phone for some nice features, will probably wait til the price drops to 599 maybe around the end of the year.

If it came with a port, you wouldn't have to adapt-- especially since there's still many choices for a jack.  Not sure why you're against options.  Also, I'll continue using phones that don't require dongles, because it means that much to me.

I am not against options but having a headphone jack usually comes with design compromises.  I would rather have the thinner phone with some newer tech than have a thicker phone because of a headphone jack.  But to each is own.  Its fine to do what you like.

True, all of those 3.5mm phones that couldn't support bluetooth. I'd much prefer my pricier, crappier headphones who's battery is limited and will crap out in a few years.

I was.  Why do you think I don't want to spend more money on hardware I already have? ;)

I use a $14 mpow bluetooth receiver with my wired earbuds.  It's super light, 10+ hours, pause/play/volume/skip buttons.  No need for overpriced bluetooth headphones.  You can leave your phone on the charger while you listen in the other room.  It's actually quite freeing.

Yeah me too! And the battery life is much better than the fancy newer ones. The audio quality is meh, though - I guess it's the drawback of the tech.

Is it waterproof? I heard somewhere that it was to OnePlus's own internal standards, but they didn't want to pay for IP certification "to pass savings on to the consumer"

they did release a video showing that its water resistent, it just not independently rated

how far does "water resistant" go for this? I have kids, waterproofing is a must
Reply

since its not IP rated, i dont think they are allowed to mention a comparable IP rating, but id say its safe to say ip67 comparable. 

Either way no phone is water proof, so always exercise caution

IP standards are just that, standards. Anyone can buy a copy and test to them. You can even state in your literature "We design our product to meet IP68 and sample test." What you cannot say is that your product is independently certified (i.e. TuV, BSi or whatever). You see this with watches where there are ones designed to resist 10 bar but not certified, and ones designed to resist 10 bar that are approved diver watches.
IP68 is an awful lot more than dunking in a bucket of water. It's a minimum of 1.5 metres deep for 30 minutes, and you can test to a higher standard if you want. I have had a Sony phone withstand serious immersion without problems, I certainly wouldn't try that with OnePlus.

Dave Lee does a review on YouTube while the phone sits in a container full of water. The phone was submerged for the whole review (about 16 minutes) and it was fine after.

Good to know but it comes down to whether it is warrantied against water intrusion or not.

It's not. But then, phones that have IP certification aren't, either.

You probably want to invest in a better waterproof case, that has protection from drops and sliding on the floor, since kids is your reason for needing it. Those Fre and Naked cases provided great protection for my Sammy's and Iphones. When they say waterproof that means that an adult handling it (which some adults act like idiots with their phones), would be able to take advantage of it. If a kid is handling the phone, you can throw that shit out the window, accidental protection is what you need. Look at all the broke or cracked iphones and ipads you see daily in peoples hands, that should tell you about how much water resistant and drop resistant really amounts to.

FAIL! No expansion and a glass back. Come on people. DO NOT add more breakable glass. So I have to add a case to protect the glass back? Then why have it? And don't EVEN think about putting it down on a smooth surface like a car fender. IT SLIDES RIGHT OFF AND BREAKS THE GLASS BACK. Again - unless I put it in a case. Sheesh...

While I agree with you on the glass getting tiresome; I should point out that the article did say it comes with a silicone case. That should protect from your "sliding off stuff" scenario.

Sorry for yelling but THEN WHY MAKE A GLASS BACK if you are going to cover it in ugly silicone! MAKE IT OUT OF SILICONE! And it won't be gorilla glass but some cheap crap that breaks easily. Of ALL the materials in the world, glass is probably the WORST choice.

Go all out (no headphone jack) to make it thin then give it a glass back so you add a thick case. Nice thought process.

Bought a Pixel 3a for my wife within 30 seconds of it going on sale for Mother's Day and it arrived a couple of days later. I gave it to her on Friday so she could get everything up and running (since she uses it as a work phone too). After a bit she finally let me see it and holy crap is it light!  I'm commenting on this because I will take a glass backed phone just for the added weight and toss a case over it.  In that sense, I'm glad the OnePlus added a glass back to the 7/7Pro. Now, just need to figure out if I'm going to pick one up because no expansion. Oh wait, internal expansion is dying and has been for a long time. As someone who balked at the idea of cloud storage, I could not care any less if a phone has expandable storage as long as it has 64GB or more.

Some people have iphones and devices that have over 128 gb filled of data they don't know how to get off. For the average user, 64 should be great, but by not putting ext storage on a device, you either save it to a pc or buy cloud storage monthly or annually. Not buying a case for any premium phone is just nuts and your asking for it, the cases give the phone better grip, since the phones are too thin and slippery for big hands. Even worse if your sweating or its wet. Device insurance is a must, if you want to sale your phone when the next model comes out. Not every keeps an immaculate phone with no case, I would just dig it and replace it when trade in time comes.

The Pixel 3a weighs the same as an iPhone 8. Being light is actually better because it means that if you do drop it, the impact will be less severe and the back is shatterproof anyway.
I have to say that if the next midrange Pixel is waterproof I might well buy it because it actually seems to be a better design from a practical viewpoint than the more expensive one.

I'll have to take your word on the weight being the same as an iPhone 8 since I've never held one before and have no interest in iDevices. Is light "actually better"?  The way I see it, a little heavier is better. It's more substantial, harder to forget that it's in your hand, more effort to knock it off a desk, etc. You apparently prefer a lighter phone and have dropsy issues.  Me, I prefer a more substantial phone that I'll wrap in a Spigen case to protect it on the off chance that my phone is dropped. All things considered, the only real reason I use a case is for that little bit of a ridge that keeps the screen off a surface if I choose to turn my phone face down since I don't use screen protectors. I've been a cell phone user since back in the day when flip phones with huge batteries were a thing and you paid per minute to use them. The only damage Iv'e doen to a phone from dropping it was to a Treo from back in the day. Dropped it and it landed directly on the antenna stub and cracked it. Phone still worked, but had a small crack. There were no cases or screen protectors and phones when adjusted for inflation (sometimes even not) were pricey like today. Figure that Treo ran around $600 in the early 2000's which would be pushing $900 based on inflation. I guess we just knew how to take care of our stuff and I to be mindful of said stuff and my surroundings.  Sorry, didn't mean to tangent, but the gist of the story...respect your investment and weight won't matter.

It’s a perfectly valid point.

A downside for the OnePlus 7 is that the Pixel 3A exists, is significantly cheaper to buy, and has (among other, smaller advantages) a clearly superior camera.

The Pixel camera hype is real. When I’m with a group of people taking photos of the same subject using their phones, the Pixel’s photos are the ones that end up being shared around – they’re simply the nicest-looking shots, and they require zero skill or effort on the part of the user. That’s a really big deal, and one of the two things that keeps me firmly in the Pixel camp (the other is stock Android).

There’s no doubt that the OnePlus is smoother, more modern looking and has various other advantages. But when the competition has such a performance advantage in an important area like camera, it makes a difference.

For some consumers, the OnePlus 7 does not compare favorably when it comes to value. It’s not necessarily a point you have to agree with, but it is a legitimate negative from Vlad’s POV.

I don’t understand the author’s hatred for MIUI. I use MIUI 10 on a Mi Max 3 alongside Android One on a Nokia 7 plus on a daily basis, and I significantly prefer MIUI 10. More smooth, more functional, more customizable, and with a third party launcher (or even Xiaomi’s own Poco launcher, which is what I use) and a good theme from the extensive theme store, it doesn’t even look that different from stock Android, especially now that with MIUI 10 notifications and the status bar have moved much closer to stock in appearance and behaviour.

Even a piece of turd will have its admirers, and MIUI isn’t quite a piece of turd.

Man I can’t be the only one that just doesn’t take that many photos outside of vacations and maybe if I got a neat lunch? Like my life is pretty damn boring.

photo taking is a minimal % of my average phone usage, so performance, display, ui, speakers etc are way more important.

Put it this way, if taking photos was that critical, the flagship pixel would’ve sold way, way better than it has. Granted google wouldn’t sell it on more than one carrier, but then again, so did apple in 2007

Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic.

Each one makes the buyer of the other feel different.

Better deal, same for less, better quality etc.

It’s no different than what we are seeing here.

Different options with minimal differences to appeal to different buyers.

Does a f0.1 aperture really make a difference between this at the 7 Pro? Cause I’ve done ab testing between f2.8 and f2.5 on two different cameras(same focal length) and I settings weren’t that far about and so at f.1 difference it should be almost the same.

It might be quite the disservice to simply state the 7 is a spec-bumped 6T and refer potential customers to the 6T review. As far as I can tell, the 6T actually carries many of the improvements in the 7 Pro (True Stereo Speakers, Larger More Accurate FP Scanner, Same Primary Camera, 200% Stronger Vibration Motor?, UFS 3.0 Storage (And along with the 7 Pro, first to market at that). I found those features, especially the first two, to make a huge difference on the 7 Pro. Basically, OnePlus has improved on many of the weaknesses in the 6T. Previously, we had a single downfiring speaker and a poor vibration motor. It would be beneficial to read a more accurate review for the 7 and not just refer to the 6T.

The curved glass and size are immediate deal breakers, more so the curved glass. I will not buy a phone or any screen that has this nonsense. I borderline hate the edge to edge display on my iPhone XS, accidentally hitting things when I have no case on the phone is maddening

The lack of headphone jack instantly made these devices a no-no for me. Even though the other features sound impressive, it doesn’t tick that basic box for me. Same goes for mi 9. The zenfone and the redmi k20 on the other hand sound a lot more appealing for the features and value they provide.

The sides on the 7 pro are not pencils line but curved, which for me is a deal breaker. And when comparing bezels with the iPhone Xs, don’t forget the chin which is bigger on the OnePlus phone… a comparison should be completely fair not always in disadvantage for one particular phone…

The OnePlus 7 Pro, comparing to the OnePlus 7, has a slightly bigger display, a better pixels density, more RAM memory, a more advenced camera, with additional captors, an extended battery capacity. Otherwise, the processor is the same. The versatile use battery life is lower.The performance are globally the same.
