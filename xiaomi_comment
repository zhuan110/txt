Nice read. For many years, Xiaomi phones have been almost enough for me in the camera department. I keep thinking: maybe next year. But they are an easy recommendation for friends.

But the OS is terrible iOS copycat.. I hated it when I used it. That said I hate almost every skin, only Samsung is not bad besides pure Android.

Samsung has been one of the worst ones for years though. It has been cleaned up a lot but it’s still bloated and obnoxious half the time.

I stopped buying Android phones but when I did I needed pure Android/Google Launcher. It was unbearable otherwise.

Yeah, I get what you mean, but I’m not sure where you’d get a better experience at the price point with Android. Maybe OnePlus. Definitely not Huawei, imo.

(Samsung skin is pretty subjective, so depending on who you are…)

No mention of the fact that half the notifications don’t show up at all on the lockscreen and are fundamentally broken (Instagram DMs, Google Calendar and so on). It’s a known issue with Xiaomi.

Uh, no mention of battery life?! This feels more like a day or two of using it compared to a full review.

Also, none of the cameras are optically stabilised, the wording above seems to imply otherwise.

I was wondering about the image stabilization!

I thought the 48mp Sony sensor did offer OIS? At least others who are using that sensor offer it.

No, it doesn’t. Most of the 48mp Sony camera modules I know of have OIS in them. There’re a few exceptions, like the upcoming Oppo Reno and the ZTE Axon 10, but the rest don’t have OIS.

And no headphone jack – I want a phone with less courage

No, you just need to get on with the times.

PCs, laptop, tablets and even cars still ship with a headphone jack, no need to "get on with the times" yet.

Do you think Nonononokii is fighting for a lost cause, or do you actually think not including the headphone jack is the right way?

Fighting for a lost cause. And honestly, if you have BT headphones and your car has BT, a headphone jack is rarely ever needed.

The notifications are broken, they don’t appear on the lock screen, and you have to unlock and open the notification shade to see them (or just to see if there are any). It’s driving me nuts!
Also it stores screenshots in the DCIM folder, so Google Photos backs them up alongside your actual photos, and you can’t change it.
After some heavy work on my part attempting to disable bloat, it’s a pretty good phone.
Definitely missing OxygenOS from OnePlus though…

This really helps cement the value of the OnePlus 6T. It’s available here, has more ram, better camera etc.

Who says the camera is better? The mi 9 camera is very very good, dxomark ranked it 6th, the Pixel 3 is ranked 13th….and the Oneplus 6T is another few slots behind the Pixel.
So no, the camera on the Mi 9 is better.

While I wouldn’t rely on DXO mark, my eyes lead me to believe I would prefer the Mi 9 camera. But software and longevity?

If you can stand MIUI, Xiaomi actually updates their phones for a pretty long time, with a few exceptions (for some reason they suspended the updates for Android Pie for the Redmi 6 series). Some old phones have been getting Oreo, like the Mi 5.

Alternatively, since Xiaomi allows for bootloader unlocks, you can go nuts with custom ROMs. This especially true for older phones.

Base ram on the 6t is a;sp 6gb, and one has to pay a few dollars to get 8gb of ram variant.

United States resident, Verizon customer, and Mi 9 + Mi Mix 3 owner here. I enjoyed this review but think that it is misleading to label Xiaomi devices as unavailable in the west. I purchased both of these devices unlocked from Gearbest (you can also try HonorBuy, Aliexpress, or Ebay) and shipping only took two days via DHL from Hong Kong to Phoenix. Gearbest was a near identical experience to buying something off of Amazon Prime. Both devices work great on Verizon and connected to LTE instantly after inserting a sim card. There are only three real problems with using Verizon:

You must manually dial ##86583## to enable VoLTE
MMS messages do not work on the default texting app but work fine on Textra
Global editions usually only support one or two Verizon 3G bands, but at least in Phoenix I hardly ever disconnect from LTE.
Otherwise, I am extremely satisfied with these devices! The quick charge on the Mi 9 is insanely fast, and the performance of the device is indistinguishable from a Galaxy S10. I personally enjoy MIUI and find it to be very polished these days. I previously was using a Pixel 2, and have been on stock Android since the Nexus S! MIUI reminds me of the old days of Cyanogen Mod with how customizable it is. I even like the navigation gestures more and find that the small things such as three finger swipe screenshots, built in call recording, and system-wide dark mode add up. Regarding the lock screen notification issues people are mentioning, you must manually enable lock screen notifications for each app from its settings. I originally felt that this was an overkill feature, but hey, I actually kind of like it. Opting-in to notifications instead of opting-out has really reduced my screen anxiety and FOMO. I like to keep it to calls, texts, and emails.

Fast and smooth aren’t the same thing and there is nothing smooth about the UI on One Plus phones which have suffered from jerky scrolling due to frame drops and poor coding in Oxygen and since the OP5.

OnePlus phones are overpriced compared to this.

I’m a Xiaomi user here in the U.S., and while I have really enjoyed the hardware, broad compatibility with software can be hit or miss. I flashed a global ROM on my China-made Xiaomi Mi 8, for example, in hopes of compatibility with Google Pay; no dice. And some games just choose not to run on your phone, because it thinks it’s rooted or because it thinks the device is from a country where the app is not supported. Magisk helps with the former; the latter, again, no dice.

Overall, I really love using my Xiaomi Mi 8 80 to 90% of the time. But for some edge cases, it can be a real downer.

(The dialer is also not very pretty, but nothing some elbow grease from xda-developers can’t fix …)
